# Composition

The most important part of AgentLite. By chaining ```Link``` objects together, we can create a LLM chain.

## Source


```python composition.py
def apipe(*functions):
    return(reduce(async_lambda, functions)) 
```

## Example
Let's try chaining some example functions here.
```python

#TODO: Testing Grounds
async def plus1(x):
    print("PLEASE")
    print(x)
    return x + 1
    
async def print1(x):
    print(x)
    print("CHECK CONCURRENCY")
    return x + 1

async def print2(x):
    print("Hello")
    return

async def trythis():
    exp = apipe(plus1, print1)
    #Prints isCoRoutine = "False", but it still runs
    print(inspect.iscoroutinefunction(exp))
    print(await exp(2))
    return
#See, it still runs with asyncio.run()
asyncio.run(apipe(plus1, print1, print2)(1))
```
