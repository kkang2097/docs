A chain contains links. Similarly, a LLM chain is a chain of ```Link``` objects. Each Link is a step in the RAG/Agent sequence.

## Source

```python link.py
class Link(BaseModel):
    #TODO: Add union type for Union(Context | dict[str, Any])
    context: T 

    @abstractmethod
    def forward(self):
        '''
            Main method for executing the Link in the LLM chain
        '''
        pass

    async def a_forward(self):
        '''
            Main method for executing the Link in the LLM chain
        '''
        pass
```
