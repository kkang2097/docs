## Inspiration
I got assigned a take-home coding assignment to use RAG to solve a business use case. I spent 10 hours on the assignment. However, 8 out of 10 hours were spent 
dealing with the "type gymnastics" of a well-known LLM framework. So I wrote my own. This library hopes to be 
<ol>
  <li>Minimal</li>
  <li>Powerful</li>
  <li>Composable</li>
  <li>Functional</li>
</ol>

This library is not a 
<ol>
  <li>replacement for LlamaIndex</li>
  <li>hub for data integrations</li>
  <li>out-of-the-box full service LLM library</li>
</ol>

Instead, I hope to arm you all with some basic structure and some functional utilities so you do what you do best: 
```python 
innovate() 
```


## Installation
You can install the library using the Python package manager, or build from source.

```bash
pip install agent-lite
```

AgentLite Github Repo: https://github.com/AgentLite/AgentLite


## Usage

AgentLite is for writing chains of RAG/Agent functions using low-level abstractions. It is highly customizable, while having interop with mainstream frameworks like
LlamaIndex or Langchain. Some highlights:
<ol>
  <li>Async Function Chaining</li>
  <li>Minimal Abstractions</li>
  <li>More to come(?) Suggestions are welcome</li>
</ol>

## Support

Currently, AgentLite only supports chains. However, when the literature around autonomous agents becomes more concrete, I plan to release an "as simple as possible" version
 of LLM agents as possible.
